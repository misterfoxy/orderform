              Accomplishments have come from creation.
              To the artist, leaving a mark on the world was impossible before cave drawing.
              To the engineer, building an automobile would have been impossible without standing upon the shoulders of likewise brilliant minds.
              To the musician, how would inspiration strike if they could not compare their newfound innovations with masters of the past?
